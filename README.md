Gravity Forms MC Unique ID Generator Field
================================

This plugin adds new field to Gravity Forms fields editor that you can use to generate random unique (site wide) identifiers like user identifiers, order identifiers, passwords, serial numbers and so on.
You can make it rendered as <INPUT type="hidden" />, <INPUT type="text" />, <INPUT type="number" /> with custom separators as well as custom HTML template.

The plugin allows field value to be separated by common separators like space, comma, dash. etc.
It supports sequence digital identifiers up to 10 digits length.

The plugin is compatible with Graivty Forms Post Update plugin. You can use shortcodes for update existing submissions 
without regeneration of identifier (identifier value will be same as on first submission that created new post in Wordpress).

[gravityform id="<FORM_ID>" update="<POST_ID>"] 
or 
[gravityform id="<FORM_ID>" update]
